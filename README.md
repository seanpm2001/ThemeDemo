The tutorial includes several checkpoints:

* [App generated by Sencha Cmd][0]
* [Demo application using the default theme][1]
* [Load different themes on different platforms][2]
* [Using the base theme as a starting point for a custom theme][3]

## Using this repository to follow the screencast

First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senchalearn/ThemeDemo.git

Change into the directory:

    cd ThemeDemo

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 0_cmd_generated_app origin/0_cmd_generated_app
    git checkout -b 1_default_theme origin/1_default_theme
    git checkout -b 2_platform_themes origin/2_platform_themes
    git checkout -b 3_base_theme origin/3_base_theme
